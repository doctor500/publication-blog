# Welcome to Publication Blog

This is a sample blog post created to demonstrate the Outstatic CMS integration.

## What is this blog?

This blog is powered by:
- **Outstatic CMS** - A headless, Git-based content management system
- **Next.js** - React framework for static site generation
- **GitHub Pages** - Free static hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated deployments

## How content works

Content is stored as Markdown files in the `outstatic/content/` directory. When you create or edit content through the Outstatic dashboard, it automatically commits changes to this repository.

GitHub Actions then builds the static site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

To add or edit content:

1. Access the Outstatic dashboard at your Vercel deployment URL
2. Log in with your GitHub account
3. Create or edit content
4. Changes are automatically deployed!
